Statistics is a fun field, but it's also confusing as h\*ll for beginners. Keeping distributions separate is hard enough (Poisson, binomial, hypergeometric, etc), but guessing which test to use can be just as confounding (ANOVA, chi-square, etc). On top of that, statistics is sorely lacking in convenient mnemonics. How are learners supposed to distinguish between p-value, t-test, F-test, Z-test, Q-statistic, k-fold validation, R, and R^2? And then there's all the other chaos beyond the fortress walls, including regularizations, transformations, paradoxes, information criteria, sampling methods, summary statistics, probabilistic math, experimental design, scedasticity, estimators, and more.

In this project, I'm setting out to build the field guide I wish I'd had when I started, with tips that are sophisticated, but written in plain English. I'm drawing inspiration from all of my favorite non-curricular, supplemental resources that helped me get started, like blog.minitab.com and statquest.org. I'm also making it colorful and interactive, like seeing-theory.brown.edu and thecrashcourse.com. And I'm making it free!

My goal is to be comprehensive, with easy-to-understand descriptions of the most obscure statistical methods and a practical groundwork for how to approach real problems. I'll be taking my own learning journey into account so that when you're confronted with new methods, you won't be stymied by overlapping use cases or intimidated by long strings of scientists' last names! (Thanks, Durbin-Wu-Hausman test.) Eventually, I'd like to extend my ambitions to other areas of math, and maybe even create a full learning environment with a platform powered by backend software. (This is a very long-term goal!) 

The way math is taught in school and the way it's used and learned in the real world are not the same. Contemporary programming resources like Codecademy make programming instantaneous and interactive. Meanwhile, math is still often relegated to paper and ink. There's no reason learning math has to be as hard as it is. Even reading Wikipedia for a cursory understanding is impossible unless you know piles of formulae. (But unless you're Russell Crowe in A Brilliant Mind, formulae in the real world are a means to an end--not the end themselves. We live in an age of calculators and reference manuals, after all!)

Statistics education is ripe for disruption, and my goal is to transfer the career-focused approaches of sites like Treehouse and Pluralsight to mathematics, but with the ethos of Brilliant.org. What can you actually do with linear algebra? What can you get out of quant finance? The answers are: quite a lot.

Stay tuned.
