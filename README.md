Statistics is fun, but it's also confusing as h\*ll. Keeping distributions separate is hard enough (Poisson, binomial, hypergeometric, etc), but knowing which test to use can be just as confounding (lasso regression, ANOVA, chi-square, Tukey's range, etc). On top of that, what are the mnemonics to remember all those pesky letters (p-value, t-test, F-test, Z-test, Q-statistic, k-fold validation, R, R^2)?? And let's not forget about all the other chaos beyond the fortress walls (regularizations, transformations, paradoxes, information criteria, sampling methods, summary statistics, probabilistic math, experimental design, scedasticity, estimators, and more).

In this project, I'm setting out to build the field guide I wish I'd had when I started, with tips that are sophisticated, but written in plain Enlighs for n00bs and dum-dums like me. (Think blog.minitab.com or statquest.org.) I'm making it colorful and interactive as well, like seeing-theory.brown.edu and thecrashcourse.com. I'm drawing inspiration from all of my favorite non-curricular, supplemental resources that helped me get started. And I'm making it free!

My goal is to be comprehensive, with easy-to-understand descriptions of the most obscure statistical methods to lay a usable groundwork for how to approach statistical problems. I'll be taking my own learning journey into account so that when you're confronted with new approaches, you won't be stymied by overlapping use cases or intimidated by long strings of scientists' last names like I was!

Eventually, I'd like to extend this goal to other areas of math, and maybe even create a full learning environment platform with more sophisticated backend software. (This is a very long-term goal!) The way math is taught in school and the way it's used and learned in the real world are not the same. New(ish) programming resources like Codecademy make coding instantaneous and interactive. Meanwhile, math is still often relegated to paper and ink. There's no reason learning math has to be as hard as it is.

Even reading Wikipedia for a cursory understanding is impossible, unless you know piles of formulae. (But also, unless you're Russell Crowe in A Brilliant Mind, formulae in the real world are a means to an endâ€”not liturgy to be obsessively recited. We live in an age of calculators and reference manuals, after all.)

The field is ripe for disruption, and my goal is to transfer the career-focused approach of Treehouse, Pluralsight, etc to mathematics, with the modularization and design of Brilliant.org. What can you actually do with linear algebra? What can you get out of quant finance? The answers are: quite a lot.

Stay tuned.
